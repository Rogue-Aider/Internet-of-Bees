# Internet-of-Bees
Let's make an ATX Beekeeping App!

## Project Concept and Goal:

Make a simple mobile-friendly app to help ATX beekeepers map and take basic notes on their hives.

Bonus Goal: Have a way for beekeeper-users to track changes in their hives and/or export data from their notes.

## Why Do This?

Austin's beekeepers need help managing their beehives so they can keep up with growing demand for healthy local honey. But existing beekeeping apps are either too complicated to be useful or missing the features ATX beekeepers really need.

We like honey and we like local businesses, so if ATX beekeepers can improve how they manage beehives then we all get healthier bees, more great local honey, and more opportunities for ATX bee businesses. Plus there are local Austin groups like the Sustainable Food Center and Community First that can use an app like this on their own beehives.

## What Skills Do We Need?

Front end, back end, user experience, graphic interface, and more!
